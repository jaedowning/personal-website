summary: Invited guest on Health Affairs podcast
abstract: "Jae Downing shared insights from their work [published in Health Affairs](https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/10.1377/hlthaff.2018.0027). At the time, transgender military was banned from serving openly in the military based on the presumption, in part, that healthcare for this population would cost more. Dr. Downing's research found that while the health of transgender civilians is worse than their cisgender peers, no differences were found in the health of transgender and cisgender veterans.
